# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to determine what Pewlett Hackard employees were eligible for retirement by filtering through the files given. We were able to find the number of employees retiring by job title who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. In addition, we found employees (born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965) who were eligible for a mentorship program.
## Results
* When looking at the retirement_titles table we are able to view all employees eligible for retirement along with the longevity of their career in their position/title held.

* In the retiring_titles it shows us the count breakdown of each level of employees at the retirement age. Based on the data below in the table the percentage breakdown is as follows: Senior Engineers - 32.5%, Senior Staff - 31.3%, Engineer - 15.7%, Staff - 13.5, Technique Leader - 5%, Assistant Engineer - 2% and Managers - 0.00002212438%
