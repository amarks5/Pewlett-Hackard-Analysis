# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to determine what Pewlett Hackard employees were eligible for retirement by filtering through the files given. We were able to find the number of employees retiring by job title who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. In addition, we found employees (born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965) who were eligible for a mentorship program.
## Results
* When looking at the retirement_titles table we are able to view all employees eligible for retirement along with the longevity of their career in their position/title held.

* In the retiring_titles it shows us the count breakdown of each level of employees at the retirement age. Based on the data below in the table the percentage breakdown is as follows: Senior Engineers - 32.5%, Senior Staff - 31.3%, Engineer - 15.7%, Staff - 13.5, Technique Leader - 5%, Assistant Engineer - 2% and Managers - 0.00002212438%. Of these stats - approximately 63.8% of the employees eligible for retirement make up the senior level positions!

* We created the unique titles table in order to view the most recent title our employees eligible for retirement are holding.

* In the mentor eligibility table we found the employees (majority in senior positions) born in 1965 that are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
Overall, the percentage of retirement ready employees that hold senior level positions is about 64%. This is a very high percentage of senior level position holders to replace! In the next 5 years there will be many positions that will need to be filled. I think it is incredibly important for this company to implement the mentorship program before all of those senior level or higher level employees retire. By doing the mentorship program, the company won't take as big of a hit when it comes to experience leaving the company due to retirement. I believe there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees available to help with the mentorship program to prepare the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
